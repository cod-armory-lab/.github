# Cod Armory Lab — Branding Guide

## Philosophy

Cod Armory Lab is a **player‑centric product**. Data exists only to help players make **better loadout decisions** and stay optimally equipped across patches.

The design must:

* Feel tactical, reliable, and game‑oriented
* Keep data transparent and supportive
* Never overwhelm the player with analytics

> *If the player feels smarter and better equipped, the design is doing its job.*
